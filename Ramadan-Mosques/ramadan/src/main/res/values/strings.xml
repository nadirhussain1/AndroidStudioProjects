    <string name="shahadah_title1">1. Introduction</string>
    <string name="shahadah_text1">The basic and most important of all the pillars of islam of Islam is Shahadah. It is a public declaration from a person starting. “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad (PUBH) is Hid Messenger.\ufffd? For a Muslim it is the base, while a non-Muslim needs to repeat the Kalima of Shahadah three time with witnesses around.</string>
    <string name="shahadah_title2">2. Believing in God</string>
    <string name="shahadah_text2">The foundation of Shahdah is the believe in Almighty Allah as a God. Moreover, besides believing in Allah, a Muslim also needs to declare that there is no one equal to Almighty Allah and no one his partner. He is the only and sole creator of all living and nonliving things and none should ever be considered equal to him.</string>
    <string name="shahadah_title3">3. Believing in Prophets</string>
    <string name="shahadah_text3">For a Muslim to fulfill Shahdah, it is mandatory to believe in all Prophets sent by Allah Almighty in addition to the belief in Prophet Muhammad (PUBH) being the last Prophet of Allah. All the prophets that were sent by Allah, preached only the oneness of Allah Almighty and showed people the right path to achieving blessing and mercy of Allah.</string>
