There are two expressions which are very easy for the tongue to say, but they are very heavy in the balance and are very dear to The Beneficent (Allah), and they are, 
سُبْحَانَ الله ِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيْمِ

Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, Subhanallahil aleem.

Meaning: 
'Glory be to Allah and by His praise and Glory be to Allah, the Immense'. 
(Book: Bukhari 6406, 6682, 7563)
