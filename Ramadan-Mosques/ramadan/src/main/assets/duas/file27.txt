Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) said, “If any servant (of Allah) who suffers from calamity says the following dua, Allah will give him reward for affliction, and would give him something better than it in exchange”. 
إِنَّا للهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُوْنَ اَللّهُمَّ أْجُرْنِيْ فِيْ مُصِيْبَتِيْ وَأَخْلِفْ لِيْ خَيْرًا مِنْهَا

Inna lillahi va innaa ilaihi raji’oon.Allahumma ajurni fee musibathi va akhlifli khayran minhaa.

Meaning: 
We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it.
(Book: Muslim 1525)
