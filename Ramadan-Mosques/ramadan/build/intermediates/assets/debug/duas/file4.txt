1. Abubakkar (Ra) inquired the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) as to what he should recite during morning, evening and before going to sleep? Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) taught him the following dua. 
اَللّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالَأرْضِ عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ رَبَّ كُلّ شَيْءٍ وَمَلِيْكَهُ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرّ نَفْسِيْ وَشَرّ الشَّيْطَانِ وَشِرْكِهِ

Allahumma fathiras samavathi val ardhi, a’alimal ghaibi wa’sh shahadhathi, rabba kulli shia in wamaleekahu, ash’hadhu an la’ilaha illa antha a’auzu bikka min sharri nafsee wa sharrish shaithani washirkihi. 

Meaning: 
O Lord! The creator of the heavens and the earth! It is You Who knows in full all that is hidden and visible. Master of the whole world! There is no God except You! I seek refuge from the evil of my own self and the evil of Satan. 
(Book: Ahmad 49, 60, 77) 

2. Whoever recites the Qur’an chapters 112,113,114 three times in morning and evening, they will suffice him against everything.

(Book: Nasa'i 5333)
