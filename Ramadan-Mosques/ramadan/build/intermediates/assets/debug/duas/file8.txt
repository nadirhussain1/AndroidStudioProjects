Allah's Apostle said, "If one says one-hundred times the following dua in one day he will get the reward of manumitting ten slaves, and one-hundred good deeds will be written in his account, and one-hundred bad deeds will be wiped off or erased from his account, and on that day he will be protected from the morning till evening from Satan, and nobody will be superior to him except one who has done more than that which he has done." 

La’ilaha illallahu wah’dhahu laa shareekalahu, lahul mulqu walahul hamdhu, wahuwa ala kulli shai’in qadheer. 
لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اقللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ دَِيْرٌ

Meaning: 
None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Alone Who has no partners, to Him belongs Dominion and to Him belong all the Praises, and He has power over all things.

(Book: Bukhari 3293)
